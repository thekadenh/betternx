# betternx
A python package that makes NetworkX better

This package is full of simple improvements to NetworkX. I have included documentation here that hopefully makes everything easy to understand and implement for your own projects.




A huge thank you goes out to Dr. Aaron Clauset for making this project possible, and for providing ideas and some of the code for this project.
